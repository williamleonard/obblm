<a name='set'><b>Setup</b></a>
<p>
In order to begin using OBBLM there are a few things you must do first.<br>
Following this guide will help you setup OBBLM for your league and give you a feeling of how OBBLM works.<br>
<ul>
    <li>To start with please create the leagues and divisions you will be using with OBBLM. This is done under the menu item: "Admin -> Management: Leagues & divisions".<br><br></li>
    <li>Now, OBBLM has two types of settings files. The <i>global</i> settings file, and the <i>local</i> settings files.<br>
    The global settings file, <i>settings.php</i>, contains settings that apply across all leagues.<br>
    The local settings files, located at <i>localsettings/settings_&lt;LEAGUE ID&gt;.php</i>, are individual league settings. There should exist <u>one for each league</u>.<br>
    Setting up these settings files should be easy since they are self-documented.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>The next thing is to create the league users/coaches. This is done under the menu item "Admin -> Management: User management".<br><br></li>
    <li>You are now ready to go. Further instructions and FAQs can be found under the menu item "OBBLM". Good luck.</li>
</ul>
