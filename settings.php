/*****************
 * House ranking systems
 *****************/

/*
    In the case of the already implemented ranking systems not fitting the needs of your league, you may define house ranking systems.
    The fields/properties which you may sort teams against are:
    
        name, mvp, cp, td, intcpt, bh, si, ki, cas (sum of player cas), tcas (total team cas), tdcas (td + player cas),
        played, won, lost, draw, win_percentage, score_team (total score made by this team), score_against (total score made against this team),
        score_diff (equals to the arithmetic value of score_team - score_against), fan_factor, smp (sportsmanship points), points
        
    The last field, points, is a special field which is defined to be the value of some arithmetical combination of other fields.
    For example, a typical points field could be constructed as so: points = '3*[won] + 2*[draw] + 1*[lost]'
    But, you may of course use any of the above fields. 

    The fields you will be defining, in order to make a working ranking system, are:
    
        rule:
            This field must take the form of: 
                array('+field1', '-field2', '+field3')
            This should be interpreted as:
                Sort first    by least of field1
                Sort secondly by most  of field2
                Sort at last  by least of field3
            Note: "+" prefix indicates least of and "-" most of. You may NOT omit any prefixes. They are required for every field!
            Note: You may define as many entries in the rule you want. It's not limited to = 3, like in this example. 
            
        points:
            This field must take the form of:
                'X*[field1] + Y*[field2] + [field3]'
            Where X and Y may by either integers, floating point numbers or another fields. 
            A points definition does not have to be a linear combination of fields, points = '[field1]/([field2]*[field3])' is 100% valid.
            Note: non-numeric fields may of course not be used in the points definition.
            
        points_desc:
            This is the text string shown in OBBLM when describing the points definition. 
            Usually the points definition is best described by setting this field to the same value as the points definition, that is:
                points_desc = points
            But, if you, for example, find it more describing writing:
                points_desc = 'Win = 3 points, draw = 2 points and losing = 1 point'
            then this too is 100% valid.
        
    PLEASE NOTE: If you do not need the points field, because it is not included in the rule field of your ranking system, 
    then simply leave both the "points" and "points_desc" definitions be equal to '' (that's two single quotes only).

$hrs[1]['points_desc'] = $hrs[1]['points'];               // Set the description of the points to be just the same as the actual definition.

// Example 2
$hrs[2]['rule']        = array('-points', '-ki', '-mvp');                   // Sort teams against: most points, then most killed and then by most MVPs.
